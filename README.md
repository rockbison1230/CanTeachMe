## Purpose

By deciphering sentiments behind a message and suggesting the hidden implications behind commonly perplexing social interactions often started from seemingly simple phrases, CMT dissolves the fog and aids neurodivergent people in seeing the same view as neurotypicals. To use it, simple paste a message received and select "Submit."
